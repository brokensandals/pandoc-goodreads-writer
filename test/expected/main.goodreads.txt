<b>Top-Level Heading</b>

<b>First Sub-Heading</b>

All right, here’s an unordered list:

- Foo

- Bar

- Baz

Let’s do a blockquote:

<blockquote>Imagine some
really beautiful prose
here

</blockquote>

Entire divs can be marked as spoilers.

<spoiler>This quote just gives too much away:

<blockquote>Dumbledore kills Snape?!?!?

</blockquote></spoiler>

Text can be <i>emphasized</i>; also you can embed <a href="https://brokensandals.net">links for shameless self-promotion</a>.

Here’s an ordered list:

1. One

2. Two

3. Three

HTML entities are used for &ldquo;double quotes&rdquo; and &lsquo;single quotes&rsquo. You can have inline <spoiler>spoilers using spans</spoiler> if you want to tantalize the reader. <b>Bold text</b> is supported.

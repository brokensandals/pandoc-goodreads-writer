# Top-Level Heading

## First Sub-Heading

All right, here's an unordered list:

- Foo
- Bar
- Baz

Let's do a blockquote:

> Imagine some
> really beautiful prose  
> here

Entire divs can be marked as spoilers.

::: {.spoiler}
This quote just gives too much away:

> Dumbledore kills Snape?!?!?
:::

Text can be _emphasized_; also you can embed [links for shameless self-promotion](https://brokensandals.net).

Here's an ordered list:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

HTML entities are used for "double quotes" and 'single quotes'. You can have inline [spoilers using spans]{.spoiler} if you want to tantalize the reader. **Bold text** is supported.
